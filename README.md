# Where Am I?

**Where Am I?** is an experimental 2D action game built with **Next.js** and **Node.js**.

- 🕹️ **First half:** A 2d platformer with **run-and-gun** and **hack-and-slash** mechanics.
- 🚀 **Second half:** a fast-paced **space shooter** sequence. Run away from whatever I decide you are running away from.
- 🌐 Entirely playable in modern web browsers.

This repository shares the **open-source code** (MIT licensed), while protecting the **game assets and story** under a separate license.
